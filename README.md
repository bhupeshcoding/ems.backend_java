I have used mysql mysql-installer-community-5.6.13.0.

Upgrading the MySQL version may or may not have an impact on your Spring Boot project, depending on the changes introduced in the newer MySQL version. In general, Spring Boot applications are built to be database-agnostic, meaning they should work with different database systems as long as the necessary configurations are provided.
